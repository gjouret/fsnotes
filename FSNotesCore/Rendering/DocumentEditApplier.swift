//
//  Phase 3 — Element-level edit application on NSTextContentStorage.
//
//  ARCHITECTURAL CONTRACT
//  ----------------------
//  `applyDocumentEdit(priorDoc:newDoc:contentStorage:...)` is the one
//  function that mutates an `NSTextContentStorage` on the TextKit 2
//  path. It takes two `Document` values (before / after) and emits
//  minimal element-level mutations via
//  `NSTextContentStorage.performEditingTransaction`.
//
//  The invariant it preserves: **elements above the first changed
//  block are untouched across every edit** (block-bounded redraw).
//
//  Block identity
//  --------------
//  This primitive does NOT invade the `Block` model with UUIDs (see
//  Phase 3 design constraints in `REFACTOR_PLAN.md`). It uses
//  **structural matching** via a Longest-Common-Subsequence diff keyed
//  on value equality (`Block: Equatable`). Blocks that are
//  byte-identical across `priorDoc` → `newDoc` are treated as
//  "unchanged" and contribute to the LCS; everything else is a delete
//  or an insert.
//
//  A secondary post-LCS pass merges adjacent `(delete priorIdx,
//  insert newIdx)` pairs of the **same block kind** at the **same
//  relative position** into a single `.modified(priorIdx, newIdx)`
//  operation. This is the typing-into-a-paragraph case: the paragraph
//  at index N has new inline content but is still a paragraph — it
//  should be reported as modified (same element slot, new content),
//  not deleted-and-inserted.
//
//  Why structural, not UUID: `Document.blockIds` exists as a side-
//  table, but its identities are ephemeral (minted fresh on every
//  parse, not serialized), so a parse-driven diff would see every
//  block as new. A structural diff works for any two `Document`
//  values regardless of origin. If a future phase needs `EditContract`
//  to carry hints ("I know block id X moved to index Y"), that's an
//  additive optimization — this primitive stays sound without it.
//
//  Rollback
//  --------
//  If the differ produces an incorrect plan for some edit, the
//  fallback is to replace-on-any-change within the affected block
//  range: treat the entire `[firstChange ... lastChange]` span as
//  one big modified chunk. That fallback is emitted today for every
//  edit — we do not split non-contiguous changes into multiple
//  transactions. This is both the "rollback position" and the v1
//  default; future passes can reduce granularity once perf metrics
//  demand.
//
//  DEBUG instrumentation
//  ---------------------
//  Under `#if DEBUG`, each call appends one line to
//  `<project-root>/logs/element-edits.log` describing the scope of
//  the edit (which element indices changed / inserted / deleted,
//  total storage length delta). Same convention as `bmLog`. Release
//  builds skip the log write entirely.
//
//  What this primitive does NOT do
//  --------------------------------
//  - Undo registration (handled by the caller — `applyDocumentEdit`
//    is stateless aside from the log).
//  - Cursor / selection preservation (the caller sets the cursor
//    after applying).
//  - IME / composition interaction (Phase 5e territory — the caller
//    is responsible for gating calls during composition).
//  - Wire-in to the live editor (Phase 3 ships the primitive + tests;
//    `fillViaBlockModel` / `handleEditViaBlockModel` still use the
//    legacy TK1 splice path until a follow-up slice).
